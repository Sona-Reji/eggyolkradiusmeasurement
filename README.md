## Basic Details
### Team Name: [init()]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Sona Reji- Govt.Engineering College Idukki
- Member 2: Ashnitha K - Govt.Engineering College Idukki


### Project Description
It's funny but it is creative.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Nobody knows the exact size of their egg yolk. Breakfast is in chaos.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Upload an egg photo, click twice, and boom‚Äîperfect yolk radius in cm. Science meets omelets.


## Technical Details

For Software:

1. Image Upload‚Äì User selects an egg photo via a file input.
2. Canvas Rendering ‚Äì The image is drawn on an HTML `<canvas>`.
3. Click Detection ‚Äì First click marks yolk center, second click marks yolk edge.
4. Radius Calculation ‚Äì JavaScript calculates pixel distance, converts to centimeters using a scaling factor.
5. Visual Feedback ‚Äì Points and circle are drawn on the canvas, and the radius is displayed on screen.
